i spent like an hr trying to get this thing working with seperate model view and controller packages
	but couldnt get it working so everything is dumped into the application package with a folder to hold the
	.fxmls. I could not get the main.java to open the fxml when they are called to load when i had things in 
	diff packages. The url would not work and would be NULL and cause fxml error "Location needed" something like that
	If someone knows how to set it up all nice and MVC thatd b cool
	
	

in the controllers the switch"    "() functions are responsible for changing the views

I set it up to pass a function object between graph view and funcInfo view
	Function obj has a string to hold the raw user input and two double for the calculated x y intercepts right now

right now theres just blank areas where more complicated shit is supposed to go like the graph and calculator
	and the fxml are ugly but i think the layout will work in general
